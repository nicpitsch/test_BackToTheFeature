# Learning Git with GitKraken

[Learning Git with GitKraken, Axosoft](https://blog.axosoft.com/2017/02/01/learning-git-with-gui/)

I’ve been with Axosoft for almost two years now, and when I started, GitKraken, the company’s Git GUI, was so new it was still in private beta. Working for the marketing team, primarily on web projects, I needed to work collaboratively and use Git on a daily basis.

I had worked with Git before, but prior to Axosoft, I was a web team of one, meaning I rarely, if ever, had to collaborate with other developers on projects. As such, the extent of my Git knowledge was git status, git commit, and, when feeling saucy:

Rebasing is a topic that comes up all the time when using Git. Many times, rebasing results in having to do a force push, which makes some people wary of rebasing. No need to worry! Once you understand why a force push is necessary, and how to rebase responsibly, you’ll feel more comfortable.
Git from the command line, for me, achieves the latter; when using the CLI for Git, I could perform simple commands that made me feel like I was doing something powerful, and maybe I was doing something powerful, but the truth is, I didn’t really know what I was doing. I understood some basics, but I did not, at all, have a sound conceptual grasp of anything outside of those simple commands. Reading up on Git piqued my interest enough to dive further in, but I hit a roadblock, and it started to feel unlearnable.
